# BingOSRS RuneLite Plugin

A RuneLite plugin that submits relevant drops to the [BingOSRS](https://bingosrs.com) API for automated bingo tracking.

## Configuration

After installing the plugin, you'll need:

- **Bingo ID**: ID of the bingo, found in the url for the bingo. Ex: `683080fa86b23d0f066ceda2`
- **Player Token**: Authorization token required to submit drops, generated by the server upon bingo creation. This should be provided by bingo admin to all participants.

Enter both in the plugin settings panel in RuneLite. Once configured, the plugin will automatically:

- Detect drops your team needs.
- Capture a screenshot.
- Submit it to BingOSRS.

## How It Works

1. Join a bingo on [bingosrs.com](https://bingosrs.com).
2. Enter Bingo ID and Player Token (provided by bingo admin) into plugin configuration.
3. Plugin runs in the background and submits required drops as they happen.
